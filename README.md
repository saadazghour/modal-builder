# Modal Builder

Modal Builder is a web application built with NextJS that allows users to easily create and customize custom popups (modals) for their websites with ease. The modals are designed to display forms that can be handled with the [Formik](https://formik.org/) library to efficiently collect user inputs.

[Formik](https://formik.org/) is a popular form library for React that simplifies form management, validation, and submission.

To learn more about [Formik](https://formik.org/) and how to use it, please refer to the [Formik Documentation](https://formik.org/docs/overview).
